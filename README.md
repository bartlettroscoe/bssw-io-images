Repository for BSSW image files

### Filesize and Resolution

Before adding an image, please pay careful attention to the file size and the pixel size. 

A file size above 10MB should be considered too large for upload to image repository. If you have such an image to upload, please attempt to resize to a more manageable size. Problems may be introduced with such large images in the repository. 

Pixel size is different than the file size and is indicated by pixel width x pixel height. To determine pixel size of your image:
* Find the location where the image is saved
* Place your cursor over the image icon, and right-click if you are using a PC or Ctrl-click if you are using a Mac.
* Choose Properties (or Get Info on Mac).
* On PC click the Details tab

An image with a pixel size less than 750 px on its largest dimension is considered under-res'ed, attempt to find a higher resolution (excludes logos)
